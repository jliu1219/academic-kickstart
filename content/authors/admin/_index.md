My name is Jin-Peng Liu (刘锦鹏). I am a third-year doctoral student of [AMSC](https://amsc.umd.edu/) program at the University of Maryland since 2017. My adviser is [Andrew Childs](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~amchilds/). 

Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree in Chinese Academy of Sciences Hua Loo Keng Class at the Beihang University in 2017. I was supervised by [Ya-xiang Yuan](http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~yyx/).

I aim to develop quantum algorithms with sup-polynomial speed-ups over classical algorithms, including topics such as quantum PDE solvers, quantum optimization and quantum machine learning. I am also interested in classical algorithms for nonlinear optimization problems.
