I am a third-year doctoral student in Applied Mathematics, & Statistics, and Scientific Computation Program at University of Maryland. My adviser is Andrew Childs. 

Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree in Hua Loo Keng Class at Beihang University in 2017. I was advised by Ya-xiang Yuan at Chinese Academy of Sciences and Tiegang Liu at Beihang University from 2015 to 2017.

I aim to develop quantum algorithms with sup-polynomial speed-ups over classical algorithms, including topics such as quantum PDE solvers, quantum optimization and quantum machine learning.

I am also interested in classical numerical analysis, mainly working on first-order methods for convex and non-convex nonlinear optimization problems.
