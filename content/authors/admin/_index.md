Jin-Peng Liu is a third-year doctoral student in Applied Mathematics, & Statistics, and Scientific Computation Program at University of Maryland. 

He aims to develop quantum algorithms with sup-polynomial speed-ups over classical algorithms, including topics such as quantum PDE solvers, quantum optimization and quantum machine learning.

He is also interested in classical numerical analysis, mainly working on first-order methods for convex and non-convex nonlinear optimization problems.

His adviser is Andrew Childs.
